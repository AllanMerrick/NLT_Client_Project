## Economic loss prediction 

### Models used : principal component analysis regression and random forest regression.

Principal component analisis regressor and random forest regression have been used into modeling process
with a 1,5 Million row data frame and 103 colunms , while the first component analysis could only capture approximatly 4.2 % of the variability, 10 components could only explain 26% of variablity of the data frame. 
with    
     
25 th  percentile of wage is expected to gain roughly by 42852$  after a disaster 
50 th percentile of  wage is expected to gain  roughly  by  99243$ after a disaster 
75 th percentile of wage  is expected to increase by 140 521$ 

the principal component analysis regression has not been an ideal choise to predict the an economic loss disaster in the industry of construction and reparation. random forest regressor perfomed quite well with 97%. 

25 th  percentile of wage is expected loss of  of  9565$  after a disaster 
50 th percentile of  wage is expected to gain  roughly  by  0$ after a disaster 
75 th percentile of wage  is expected to increase by 52582$ 

We can see huge marge error or  difference in loss prediction between the 2 models on the 50 th percentile of income which  is expected to see a significant loss of 99243$  using component analyse regression while the random forest regression predicts 0$ loss on the 50 percentille of income in the construction industry.
